# Vasont Inspire Models Documentation

## Introduction

The GlobalLink Inspire CCMS Models is an open-source connector library, maintained by GlobalLink Vasont in GitHub, that provides the specific class models used within the Vasont Inspire Api and SDK.

The Inspire Web API is organized around [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer). Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts [form-encoded request bodies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POST_(HTTP)#Use_for_submitting_web_forms), in almost all cases returns [JSON-encoded responses](https://www.json.org/), returns [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) in most cases, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

Developers who are working within the Inspire Preview environment (Sandbox, Demo, 3rd Party Developers) will work with Preview versions of the API and related SDK versions.

Live Inspire customers will work with [LTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_support) versions of the API and related SDK versions.
